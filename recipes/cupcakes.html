        <p>Chocolate and zucchini cupcakes with nuts - what could be better? Use pecans in place of walnuts if you like. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, melted</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups grated zucchini</li>
            <li>¾ cup chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package chocolate frosting</li>
            <li>½ cup walnut halves </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat eggs with sugar for about 10 minutes or until thickened and pale. Blend oil and cooled chocolate into the beaten egg mixture.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; stir flour mixture into egg mixture until just blended. Stir in zucchini and chopped nuts. Using an ice-cream scoop, spoon batter into 24 paper-lined or greased muffin cups, filling the cups 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20 minutes or until fork or toothpick inserted in a cupcake's center comes out clean. Let cool in pans on rack for 10 minutes. Remove from pans; let cool completely. Spread with chocolate frosting and garnish with walnut or pecan halves.</li>
